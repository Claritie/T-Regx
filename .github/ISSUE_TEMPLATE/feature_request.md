**Describe your feature**
Please paste here a code sample of a new method that could be added to T-Regx. If your feature is not about API, but the behaviour in general, please a sample code and it's current and expected return values or parameters. In short, just paste code with a new feature :)

**Describe what problem does this feature solve**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Is there a (possibly worse) way to accomplish the result without this feature?**
Is it possible to achieve the same result without this feature implemented? If so, please describe and/or paste code presenting the current way to receive the expected result now (before this feature is added). If it's not possible, just leave this field blank.

**Additional context**
Add any other context, your ideas or possible problems you'd expect here.
